# 4370_CinemaCitizen

Introduction:
The Cinema Citizen App is a web-based application designed to allow users to search and rate movies, as well as modify movie information. The application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the movie database.
Motivation:
#Among the ideas we propose, this is one that satisfies most requirements of the project.
	#Relatively achievable with clear development direction (Also want a good grade)
	#Strongly connected with daily life (people go to movies, write/read reviews) However, many existed moving rating websites often have many interfering factors and external disturbances such as:
a.	Not private enough
b.	extremely fixed user group formed in the past, difficult to fit in
c.	things like malicious bad reviews or fake good reviews for business purposes
	#Potential feature expansion & upgrade in the future
	#If we did this well maybe we can put it on our resume
Objective:
	#Front-end: Good Visuals and Page Layout
#Back-end: Using a good framework and build a good API and DB that are: time efficient; safe; expandable; robust
#In general, we want to build an app with Functional integrity, runs smoothly, and meet project requirements. 
#Foster a community and provide a platform: The Cinema Citizen app wish to create a community of real movie enthusiasts who like to share recommendations, discuss movies, and provide a platform for them to share their reviews and ratings with others; therefore, enhance the user's movie-watching experience and maybe find like-minded thoughts or new inspirations.
